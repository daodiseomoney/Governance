# Our approach to DAODISEO Governance
In the DAODISEO blockchain, a decentralized governance is designed specifically for the real estate sector, each of the seven key stakeholder groups acts as validation nodes, ensuring that their unique needs and insights influence the governance and operation of the network. 
This approach not only promotes fairness and transparency but also enhances the functionality and responsiveness of the system to serve the diverse requirements of all parties involved.

Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities:

1. Tenants or Buyers: Represented as validation nodes, tenants and buyers ensure that the platform remains user-friendly and digitally accessible, catering to their need for seamless property searches with robust filtering options and minimal physical interactions. Their presence in the governance structure helps prioritize developments that enhance user experience and digital transactions.

2. Brokers: By serving as validation nodes, brokers help streamline communication channels within the network. Their input is crucial for integrating features that support quality marketing, lead generation, and deal cycle visualization, thereby facilitating efficient brokerage operations within a single, automated system.

3. Landlords: As nodes, landlords can safeguard the processes related to setting appropriate asking prices and maintaining transparency in rental and sales transactions. Their involvement is key to implementing reliable background checks and ensuring that the platform supports the integrity of tenant-landlord relationships.

4. Property Managers: Property managers contribute to the governance by emphasizing the importance of tools for managing multiple properties, such as automated rent collection and maintenance management. Their insights help develop functionalities that improve operational efficiency and financial reporting across property portfolios.

5. Mortgage Brokers: Their role as nodes supports the alignment of platform functionalities with the needs of both lenders and borrowers, ensuring clarity in loan terms and documentation requirements. This groupâ€™s participation helps integrate and optimize loan processing platforms, benefiting all parties involved in real estate financing.

6. Appraisers: Appraiser nodes advocate for features that support mobility and flexibility in property valuations, such as automated valuation models and comprehensive market analysis tools. Their expertise is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of property assessments, which are integral to the real estate market.

7. Investors: Investors, particularly those involved in real estate investment trusts (REITs), focus on functionalities that provide deep financial analysis, robust portfolio management, and detailed reporting. As nodes, they ensure that the network serves the analytical needs and strategic interests of real estate investors, promoting transparency and accountability in investor relations.

By including each group as validation nodes in the decentralized governance model of DAODISEO, the blockchain network ensures that all functionalities and updates are comprehensively vetted by representatives who understand and prioritize the nuanced needs of their respective sectors. 
This structure not only enhances the adaptability and efficiency of the network but also fosters a collaborative ecosystem where all stakeholders have a voice in shaping the landscape of real estate transactions and management.
